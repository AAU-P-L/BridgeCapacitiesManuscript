@article{Meng.2015,
 abstract = {For oversized cargo transportation, traditional transportation schemes only consider road length, road width, the transportation cost as weight values in analysis and calculation of route selection. However, for oversized trucks, turning direction at road intersections is also a factor worth considering. By introducing the classical algorithm of Dijkstra into the model of road network, this research considers the size of turning angle at intersections as the weight value of the edge in the auxiliary network based on the weight values of road corners, upon which the shortest path analysis is performed. Then, an optimal path with minimum time cost was eventually obtained. The proposed algorithm was analyzed and compared with the traditional shortest path algorithm and it reported that our method could reduce the time for oversized trucks to pass through intersections. In addition, the proposed algorithm could be adapted to the complex and diverse road networks and provide a reliable scheme for route selection of oversized trucks.},
