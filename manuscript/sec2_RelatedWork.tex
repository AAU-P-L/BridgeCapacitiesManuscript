Increasing economic development, general technological progress, and the growing prevalence of large-scale facilities, such as wind mills or power plants, increase the demand for OHC transports.
Frequently, these transport processes are executed within the road network. This is because roads exhibit a high geographical coverage and thus, provide a certain amount of flexibility and cost saving potential, as goods can often be delivered directly without any time-consuming handling or transshipment efforts being required. However, taking into account the complexity of road transportation, OHC route selection is a challenging task \cite{Bazaras.2013, xu2001methodology, sivilevicius2007dynamics}.
Yet, selection of an optimal route based on reasonable route planning methods greatly improves the efficiency of OHC transports \cite{meng2015optimized}.
Therefore, optimal route selection in the field of road-related OHC has recently become a topic of high relevance \cite{geisberger2011efficient}.
\par
This paper is building upon past research on OHC routing. In the literature, a wide range of different approaches to this issue are presented.
One particular method for optimal route selection is the integration and processing of all available data concerning the road network in a Geographic Information System (GIS) \cite{durham2002gis}.
According to Datla et al. \cite{datla2004gis}, a GIS facilitates identification of shortest paths, while taking into account characteristics and attributes of the road network as well as the involved transport vehicles, provided that data are available and up-to-date. This planned route is usually chosen by evaluating the vehicle parameters and dimensions, such as height, width, and weight, together with the load and weight distribution and other characteristics to ensure road safety or prevent damage to road infrastructure, e.g. bridges \cite{ecmt2006improving, vaitkus2016effect, kombe2017modelling, pauer2017development}.
\par Others such as Batarlienė \cite{batarliene2007mobile} and Parentela \cite{parentela2002risk} investigate different aspects of transportation risks and traffic intensity evaluation via mathematical dependencies that allow the planning of traffic intensity in certain road sections.
In general, mathematical prinicples are beneficial when planning OHC transportation routes.
Woxenius \cite{woxenius2002organisation, woxenius2002conceptual}, Rodrigue \cite{rodrigue2020geography} state that, during the planning of a new road, or the reconstruction of an existing one, technical and economic calculations must be carried out.
These calculations must be carried out considering the economic convenience of the road.
The calculation fundamentals of freight transport and cargo handling proposed by these researchers could be applied when dealing with the same calculations in the case of OHC transportation. However, the situations of multiple uses of road transportation infrastructure for OHC carriage should be taken into account.

The literature review has shown that considering bridge capacities as a limiting factor for OHC route selection has not been scientifically analyzed so far.
It is obvious that such a drawback is caused by the insufficient information availability of the road network infrastructure to the process of OHC handling.
Therefore, addressing the methodologies and systems of OHC transportation planning, the above-mentioned circumstance should be considered.
The routes eligible for oversized and heavy cargoes should always be considered as part of the system of economic infrastructure of the respective economic territory.
