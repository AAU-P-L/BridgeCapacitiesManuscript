\subsection{Study setting}
The study at hand was conducted as part of the joint Interreg project SWEET (Single Window for Exceptional Transport) with the objective to harmonize cross-border OHC transportation between Austria and Italy \cite{Sweet}. In detail, the project pursues the goal of developing and implementing a digital platform solution to enable coordinated processing of OHC related tasks. Here, special interest lies in the streamlining of different national legislations, simplifiening of authorization processes, improving governance and enabling real-time monitoring of transports. The project further fosters the determination of adequate transport corridors and the automatization of optimal route selection as part of the OHC planning phase. This is where the subsequent study contributes by proposing a robust mathematical approach to provide decision-making support to practicioners.
